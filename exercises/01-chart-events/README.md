# Exercise 01

1. Add to the Chart A a simple shape (triangle) using `chart.load` event.
2. Add to the Chart B a simple shape (circle) using `chart.render` event.
3. The shapes should resize altogether with the charts:
    - on brower's resize (shrinking browser should also shrink the radius of the circle)
    - on chart zoom (eg circle center should remain on x=5)
